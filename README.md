# Enoch Pratt Free Library Locations in Baltimore City

This web app finds and maps the location of every Baltimore city public library listed on the Enoch Pratt Library website.

It makes use of a JSON data set and utilizes Google Maps Javascript API.

This was inspired by a public JSON data set located at [https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Libraries/tgtv-wr5u](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Libraries/tgtv-wr5u). Unfortunately the file was incomplete and could have been organized better, so I went through the Pratt Library website to collect data and created my own JSON file to reference.
