## Description
This is a single-page application written with AngularJS that assembles information queried from a JSON data set and drops a location pin on a map for every Baltimore City public library listed on the [http://www.prattlibrary.org/](Enoch Pratt Library) website.

This was inspired by a public JSON data set located at [https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Libraries/tgtv-wr5u](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Libraries/tgtv-wr5u). Unfortunately the file was incomplete and could have been organized better, so I went through the Pratt Library website to collect data and created a custom JSON file to reference.

I am currently making use of the Bootstrap framework for the sake of brevity, the focus is on functionality
