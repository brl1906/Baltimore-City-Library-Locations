# Enoch Pratt Free Library Locations in Baltimore City

## Demo


## Description
This is a single-page application that finds and maps the location of every Baltimore city public library listed on the Enoch Pratt Library website.

It utilizes Google Maps Javascript API and assembles information queried from a JSON data set

This was inspired by a public JSON data set located at [https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Libraries/tgtv-wr5u](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Libraries/tgtv-wr5u). Unfortunately the file was incomplete and could have been organized better, so I went through the Pratt Library website to collect data and created a custom JSON file to reference.
